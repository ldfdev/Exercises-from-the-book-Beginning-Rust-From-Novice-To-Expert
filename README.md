# Exercises-from-the-book-Beginning-Rust-From-Novice-To-Expert
For each chapter I implement Rust snippets based on the content of the chapte.

This helps experimenting with Rust syntax and idioms

All snippets are organised based on this book chapters

### What are Fictive Chapters ?

Theese chapters are fictive in the sense that they do not appear in the book. I introduced them as a way to group information sharing a dedicated topic
 that could be easily searched for and checked.

### Disclaimer

These exercises are written by me as code snippets to prove my understanding of the features of Rust and to grasp the concepts more easily.
 Furthermore there is no corresponce between my exercises and *official* exercises from the book.
